Because the "Open CV" libraries could not be installed directly on python3, we need PIP for the installation. 
Also the version of "Open CV" should match the version of "Visual Studio" on your device to realise the functions. 
Numpy is also used but it is default in Anaconda.

#Download this file if PIP is not installed: get-pip.py
#Open a cmd prompt and navigate to the file location
#Run commands:
python get-pip.py
pip install opencv-python
